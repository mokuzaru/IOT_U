# IOT Class: Level Basic

This is a course to begin in the worl of iot. At the first weeks we are going to cover the basics knowledge of electronics devices like: developer boards (arduino, ESP and others), software to program the devices and drivers, hardware modules, sensors, actuators, and other stuff. By the second part of the course we are going to see protocols of communication, backend, databases and servers.

## Requeriments

- Arduino development board (any one works for this pourpose).
    - If you are using an arduino board must have the wifi or ethernet shield board.
- ESP development board (in this case buy or esp8266-12, also call nodeMCU, or ESP32).
- Shield boards ( ldr board, relay, HC04 or others).
- Sensor (DHT11, DHT22, lm35 or others).
- PC (with arduino IDE complete version)


## First week
At the first week we are going to cover the basics of electricity and electronics before we get into practice part. Here are some topics:

- OHM laws
  - Why is important
- AC/DC
- Sources
- Pasive components
- Loads
- Sensors/actuators
- Controllers
- Arduino
- Basics samples

## Second week

At the second week we see the materials to build the projects.

List of items.

### Random items 4 random projects

- Arduino nano
- Serial TTL converter
- jumpers
- IMU (acelerometer and gyroscope)
- litium batery charger: Module TP4056 or 03962A
- Board sim800
- bluetooth board HC-06
- Conversor DC DC LM2596


## Third week

[How to use litium batery charger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqjcenit4_Y)

Then we must create a simple but useful board to protect our circuits from reverse polarity.

## Fouth week

At this week start connecting stuf to test sensor and actuators with the controller (arduino). In order to learn about deeper concepts of electronics and data adquisition (basic telemetry).
At the end of this session must know the value range of the sensor and data adquisition. Some examples:

Range of DHT11 :  from 0째 to 50째
Range of DHT22 : from -40째 to 80째
HC-04 (ultrasonic): from 3cm to 300 cm

Note: Use diferent sensors (besides the sensors of your project).
