# IOT Class: Level Basic

This is a course to begin in the worl of iot. At the first weeks we are going to cover the basics knowledge of electronics devices like: developer boards (arduino, ESP and others), software to program the devices and drivers, hardware modules, sensors, actuators, and other stuff. By the second part of the course we are going to see protocols of communication, backend, databases and servers.

## Requeriments

- Arduino development board (any one works for this pourpose).
    - If you are using an arduino board must have the wifi or ethernet shield board.
- ESP development board (in this case buy or esp8266-12, also call nodeMCU, or ESP32).
- Shield boards ( ldr board, relay, HC04 or others).
- Sensor (DHT11, DHT22, lm35 or others).
- PC (with arduino IDE complete version)


## First week
At the first week we are going to cover the basics of electricity and electronics before we get into practice part. Here are some topics:

- OHM laws
  - Why is important
- AC/DC
- Sources
- Pasive components
- Loads
- Sensors/actuators
- Controllers
- Arduino
- Basics samples

## Second week

*Comming soon*
